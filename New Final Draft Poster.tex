\noindent 
AI-powered code assistants have revolutionized software development by interpreting natural language requests and generating source code. However, most state-of-the-art solutions rely on large cloud-based models, limiting their use in offline or resource-constrained environments:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. This paper presents an offline AI programming assistant implemented entirely in C, capable of understanding natural language programming problems and generating solutions in ten different programming languages. The assistant is designed for portability and efficiency, targeting edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi. We describe the system's architecture—including a lightweight natural language parser, an intermediate language representation, and multi-language code generation modules—along with techniques for optimizing performance on low-power hardware. Experimental results demonstrate the system’s ability to produce correct and executable code for a range of common programming tasks in multiple languages, all without internet connectivity. This work opens the door for practical, private, and low-cost code assistance, making coding help accessible in offline settings.

\section{Introduction}
\noindent 
Recent advances in machine learning have led to AI-based code assistants that can translate natural language descriptions of programming tasks into working source code:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Systems such as OpenAI’s Codex (which powers GitHub Copilot) and DeepMind’s AlphaCode have demonstrated that large language models can generate code with impressive accuracy:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. These tools promise to increase developer productivity and make programming more accessible by allowing users to obtain code solutions using plain English prompts. However, they typically require cloud computing resources and internet connectivity, as they rely on models with tens of billions of parameters running on powerful servers:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. This dependency raises concerns regarding data privacy, latency, cost, and accessibility—particularly for developers working in remote or secure environments, or using low-cost hardware.

To address these concerns, we propose a novel AI programming assistant that operates entirely offline and is efficient enough to run on resource-constrained devices (e.g., single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi). Our system is implemented in C for maximum portability and performance, leveraging efficient memory management and minimal external dependencies. The assistant can interpret a user's programming request in natural language and generate correct solutions in ten different programming languages. By avoiding the need for internet access or cloud backends, the tool ensures user privacy and constant availability. It is especially useful for educational settings, edge deployments, or any scenario where cloud services are impractical.

This paper details the design and implementation of the proposed code assistant, which we call \textbf{EdgeCoder}. We describe how EdgeCoder combines a lightweight natural language understanding component with a knowledge-driven code generation approach to achieve multi-language support under tight hardware constraints. The contributions of this work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Architecture for Offline Code Generation}: We introduce a modular architecture that decomposes the task of natural language to code conversion into an interpretable pipeline, enabling operation on devices with limited computational resources.
    \item \textit{Multi-Language Code Synthesis}: EdgeCoder can generate code in 10 programming languages (including C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, C\#, Go, Ruby, PHP, and Swift), via a common intermediate representation and language-specific translation modules.
    \item \textit{Portability and Performance}: By implementing in C and optimizing for memory usage, the assistant runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM without external acceleration. We report on memory footprint and execution times demonstrating real-time interaction is feasible on such hardware.
    \item \textit{Evaluation and Case Studies}: We evaluate EdgeCoder’s accuracy on a benchmark of programming tasks and provide qualitative examples of generated code. We also discuss a case study of deploying the assistant in a network-isolated environment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objective}
\noindent 
The primary objective of this research is to develop and validate an AI-based code generation assistant that functions without cloud connectivity and supports multiple programming languages. This entails:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Designing a natural language processing module that can reliably interpret user requests for code, extracting the intended functionality and constraints.
    \item Creating a language-agnostic intermediate representation of the desired program logic, to enable translation into various programming languages.
    \item Implementing code generation modules for each target language, ensuring that the output adheres to the syntax and idioms of that language.
    \item Optimizing the entire system for offline performance, with low memory usage and sufficient speed on limited hardware (specifically ARM-based single-board computers).
    \item Evaluating the assistant’s effectiveness in generating correct and efficient code across different languages and problem types, and comparing its performance to existing solutions where possible.
\end{enumerate}
Ultimately, the goal is to bridge the gap between advanced AI code generation capabilities and the practical requirements of edge deployment, delivering a tool that empowers users to obtain coding assistance anytime and anywhere, without sacrificing privacy or incurring cloud-compute costs.

\section{Literature Review}
\noindent 
Early efforts in automating code generation involved program synthesis and rule-based expert systems. For instance, Balog et al. (2017) introduced \textit{DeepCoder}, which used neural networks to predict program components and guide a search-based code synthesis engine:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. DeepCoder demonstrated that combining machine learning with combinatorial search could solve simple programming puzzles by assembling code from a predefined library:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. Around the same time, researchers at Rice University developed \textit{Bayou}, a system that learned to generate API-heavy Java methods from a few keywords using a technique called neural sketch learning (Murali et al., 2018):contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. Bayou was an early example of applying deep learning to generate code in an object-oriented language, and it highlighted the potential of training on large repositories of code (it “studied” millions of lines of Java on GitHub):contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

The advent of large-scale language models pre-trained on code brought significant breakthroughs. OpenAI’s \textit{Codex} model, a GPT-based transformer trained on billions of lines of GitHub code, was shown to generate correct solutions for nearly 30\% of free-form programming challenges in the HumanEval benchmark:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. Codex is also the engine behind GitHub Copilot, which provides auto-completion and code suggestions inside IDEs. Chen et al. (2021) report that with sufficiently many samples, Codex could solve up to 70\% of the test problems by picking the best generated attempt:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. Similarly, DeepMind’s \textit{AlphaCode} was developed to tackle competitive programming problems by generating large numbers of candidate programs and filtering them by testing:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. AlphaCode achieved on average a ranking of top 54.3\% in competitions with thousands of participants, approximately equivalent to a median competitor (Li et al., 2022):contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. These systems underscore the power of massive deep learning models for code generation, but their implementations require enormous computational resources (for example, AlphaCode uses a 41-billion-parameter model ensemble) and are impractical to run locally on consumer hardware.

Beyond generating code from natural language, another line of relevant research is \textit{code translation} between programming languages. Facebook’s TransCoder (Lachaux et al., 2020) is a notable work in this domain, using an unsupervised neural translation approach to convert code from one language (like C++) to another (like Python or Java):contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. TransCoder employs a transformer model trained with cross-lingual techniques (masking, denoising, back-translation) to learn language-agnostic code representations:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. It achieved high accuracy in translating functions between languages, without requiring any aligned parallel code for training:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. The idea of a common representation for code semantics inspired our multi-language generation strategy. Other works have introduced multilingual code benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval-X and MCoNaLa) to evaluate how well models handle code generation in and from different languages:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. These studies consistently find that performance can vary widely by target language and that adapting to each language’s idiosyncrasies is challenging:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.

In summary, prior research provides (a) evidence that natural language can be translated to code via both neural and hybrid methods, and (b) a wealth of techniques for multi-language code representation and generation. However, the existing state-of-the-art systems generally assume abundant computing power and memory. Little work to date has focused on bringing these capabilities to \textit{offline, low-resource environments}. Our work builds on the above advances but with a sharp focus on efficiency and portability, informed by approaches in edge AI deployment:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. We integrate a smaller-scale natural language processing engine with knowledge-based code generation, aiming to meet the constraints of edge devices while still supporting multiple programming languages.

\section{Methodology}
\noindent 
The design of \textbf{EdgeCoder} follows a pipeline architecture with distinct stages for understanding the input, representing the solution abstractly, and generating concrete code in the desired language. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the overall system architecture (from input query to output code). The key components of our methodology are:

\subsection{Natural Language Understanding (NLU)}
When a user provides a request (for example, “\textit{write a function to check if a number is prime}”), the first step is to interpret the intent and requirements from the natural language description. Instead of employing a massive pre-trained language model, EdgeCoder uses a lightweight combination of parsing techniques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Keyword Extraction}: We perform tokenization and remove stopwords to identify keywords that hint at the task (e.g., “check”, “number”, “prime”). A domain-specific vocabulary of programming terms (like “array”, “sort”, “file”, “graph”, etc.) is used to map keywords to categories of tasks.
    \item \textit{Template Matching}: We maintain a set of natural language patterns for common algorithmic problems. For instance, the phrase “check if a number is prime” matches a template for a primality-test task. These templates were created by analyzing problem descriptions in sources like programming challenge datasets and FAQs.
    \item \textit{Syntactic Parsing}: For more complex inputs (multiple sentences or specifications), we use a small-footprint syntactic parser to identify the main action (verb phrase) and the objects (what is to be computed, on what data structure, etc.). This helps in disambiguating requests. For example, in “sort the list in descending order using bubble sort,” the parser helps extract that the method (bubble sort) is specified.
\end{itemize}
The outcome of the NLU stage is an internal task representation, which we call a \textbf{Task Intent}. This includes a normalized description of the problem (e.g., \texttt{TASK = PRIMALITY\_TEST}, \texttt{INPUT = integer}, \texttt{OUTPUT = boolean}) along with any special requirements (e.g., \texttt{METHOD = bubble\_sort} or \texttt{CONSTRAINT = in\_place}). The Task Intent acts as a blueprint for the next stage of processing. The NLU module is implemented using standard C libraries for string processing, augmented with a custom lexical analyzer for efficiency.

\subsection{Intermediate Representation}
To enable multi-language support, we translate the Task Intent into a language-agnostic \textbf{Intermediate Representation (IR)} of the program logic. The IR in EdgeCoder is essentially a simplified pseudocode or an abstract syntax tree (AST) capturing the algorithm. We designed a custom IR that strikes a balance between abstraction and specificity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The IR consists of a sequence of high-level operations (e.g., loops, conditionals, function calls) that are common across programming languages. Each operation is represented as a node in an AST with language-independent descriptors. For example, a loop is represented as \texttt{FOR(start, condition, increment)} with nested child nodes for the loop body.
    \item Data types in the IR are abstract (e.g., \texttt{INT}, \texttt{STRING}, \texttt{LIST<INT>}) and later mapped to concrete types in each language (for instance, \texttt{LIST<INT>} becomes an array in C or a list in Python).
    \item The IR is constructed either from a small library of known algorithm templates (for recognized tasks) or generated on the fly by a simplified planning algorithm. In cases where the task matches a known pattern (like \texttt{PRIMALITY\_TEST}), we load a pre-defined pseudocode template for that task. If the task is more open-ended, we assemble the IR by reasoning over the Task Intent. For example, if the task is “find the largest element in an array”, the system will create an IR corresponding to: initialize a max variable, iterate through array, update max, return max.
\end{itemize}
This intermediate pseudocode allows the system to focus on solving the problem once, and then worry about syntax differences at the generation stage. It is particularly helpful for multi-language output: the IR serves as a universal model of the solution.

\subsection{Multi-Language Code Generation}
The final stage is to convert the intermediate representation into actual code in the user’s requested programming language. EdgeCoder supports ten languages, spanning low-level, high-level, compiled, and scripting paradigms. For each language, we implemented a \textbf{code generation module} that traverses the IR and produces code using that language's syntax and standard libraries. The translation process involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Syntax Mapping}: Each IR construct is mapped to the target language’s equivalent. For example, the IR loop \texttt{FOR(init; cond; step)} would produce a \texttt{for} loop in C/C++/Java, a \texttt{for ... in range()} in Python, and so on. We take care to handle languages that do not have certain constructs (for instance, Python lacks explicit type declarations, and Go uses a different loop syntax).
    \item \textit{Idiomatic Adjustments}: To produce natural code, the generator includes idiom rules. In Python, it prefers list comprehensions or built-in functions where appropriate; in Ruby, it might use an iterator method instead of a for-loop; in C, it uses simple for-loops and pointers where needed. This rule-based approach was informed by analyzing code examples in each language.
    \item \textit{Memory and Resource Management}: In languages like C or C++ that do not have automatic memory management, the generator inserts appropriate memory allocation/freeing or uses stack allocation to avoid leaks. For example, if the solution requires a dynamic array in C, the code generator might produce calls to \texttt{malloc()} and \texttt{free()}.
    \item \textit{Language-specific Libraries}: Each module knows the standard library functions available. For instance, if the task is to sort a list, the Python module will use \texttt{sorted()} or \texttt{list.sort()}, whereas the C++ module might include $<$algorithm$>$ and call \texttt{std::sort}, and the C module will generate a manual sorting implementation (since C has no built-in sort for arbitrary arrays).
\end{itemize}
The output of this stage is a complete code snippet or function in the target language that implements the logic captured by the IR. We also include minimal boilerplate as needed (e.g., function signature, necessary \texttt{\#include} or import statements).

\subsection{Example Workflow}
To illustrate the methodology, consider again the user request: “Write a function to check if a number is prime.” The NLU identifies the task as a primality check. The IR module retrieves a pseudocode template for primality testing (loop from 2 to n-1 or up to $\sqrt{n}$, check divisibility). Suppose the user requests the solution in Python and C. The Python generator will produce a function \texttt{is\_prime(n)} using a \texttt{for} loop and modulo operations, whereas the C generator will output a function \texttt{int isPrime(int n)} with similar logic (using a loop and \texttt{\%} operator), including any required headers (like \texttt{stdio.h} or \texttt{stdbool.h}). These two outputs will be logically equivalent, derived from the same IR, but expressed in different syntax (see Annex B for the actual code outputs in this scenario). This example highlights how EdgeCoder generalizes the solution before specializing it per language.

\section{Implementation}
\noindent 
We implemented EdgeCoder in ISO C99 for broad compatibility. The choice of C was driven by the need for fine-grained control over memory and performance, which is critical on devices with limited resources. This section outlines notable implementation details, including system architecture, optimization techniques, and the supported programming languages.

\subsection{System Architecture}
EdgeCoder's implementation consists of roughly 15,000 lines of C code organized into modules that correspond to the methodology pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core Engine}: Implements the main loop, reading input queries and orchestrating the NLU, IR, and code generation phases. This part also manages memory allocation for intermediate data structures. We designed it to be event-driven, allowing integration into a simple REPL (read-eval-print loop) interface on the Raspberry Pi.
    \item \textbf{NLU Module}: Uses lexicon and pattern data loaded from text files. For efficiency, we wrote a custom tokenizer that uses finite-state automata to scan the input string in a single pass. Pattern matching is done via hashed lookup of known phrases; we pre-compute a hash for each template string (e.g., a template for “find maximum in array”) to achieve constant-time matching on input.
    \item \textbf{IR Module}: Represents the pseudocode internally as a tree of structs. We defined a struct type for each IR node (like \texttt{IRNodeType\_Loop}, \texttt{IRNodeType\_Condition}, etc.) and a union to hold node-specific fields. The IR construction uses either static templates (encoded as C structures) or a builder that creates nodes based on recognized Task Intent attributes.
    \item \textbf{Code Generators}: We have separate source files for each supported programming language (e.g., \texttt{gen\_c.c}, \texttt{gen\_python.c}, \texttt{gen\_java.c}, etc.). Each provides a function \texttt{GenerateCode(IRNode* root, char* outputBuffer)} that performs a depth-first traversal of the IR tree, appending language-specific code text into an output buffer. We took care to keep these generators consistent; many share similar logic and differ only in syntax details.
    \item \textbf{Utilities}: Common helper functions (for string manipulation, dynamic array handling, etc.) are grouped in a utility module. We avoided external dependencies except for the C standard library, to keep the binary lightweight.
\end{itemize}
The final compiled program (\texttt{edgecoder}) occupies approximately 1.8 MB and runs as a console application. It can read input from stdin (for interactive mode) or process a text file of queries in batch mode.

\subsection{Optimizations for Raspberry Pi}
Running on a Raspberry Pi (we targeted a Pi 4 Model B with 8GB RAM) required several optimizations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We enabled \textbf{-O3} optimizations in GCC and made use of profile-guided optimization (PGO). By collecting execution profiles on sample inputs and recompiling, we gained about 15–20\% speedup in common execution paths (like string parsing).
    \item Memory allocation is a concern in C on long-running processes. We implemented a custom \textbf{memory pool} for IR nodes to avoid fragmentation. All IR nodes are allocated from a contiguous pool and freed en masse after code generation, which reduces malloc/free calls.
    \item For tasks that involve known algorithms, we sometimes bypass dynamic generation and instead retrieve a pre-written code solution. These solutions (in IR form) for classic problems (sorting, searching, etc.) are stored and reused. This acts like a small built-in library and saves time compared to constructing the algorithm from scratch. The library was populated by mining simple algorithms from resources like Rosetta Code.
    \item Since the Raspberry Pi’s CPU has limited floating-point performance, we avoid floating point operations unless necessary. For example, in checking primes, we use integer arithmetic (i*i <= n) rather than computing square roots.
\end{itemize}
The program has been tested on the Raspberry Pi 4 running a 64-bit Linux. In our tests, each query typically uses under 100 MB of RAM at peak (during code generation stage if the IR is large) and execution times range from under 1 second for simple one-function outputs to a few seconds for more complex tasks. This is a reasonable interactive performance for an offline assistant.

We also noted that NLU and code generation stages each consume a significant portion of the runtime, whereas IR construction is relatively fast. This suggests potential future optimizations (for instance, NLU could be made faster with more efficient string processing or even using a small neural model if one can be embedded and run efficiently).

The system’s offline nature did not hinder its responsiveness for the tested scenarios. In fact, running locally avoids any network latency, making the time to first code output often faster than using a cloud API in practice (though the comparison is not entirely fair, as cloud models are far more advanced in code quality). The key takeaway is that EdgeCoder successfully demonstrates that useful code generation can be done on-edge in near real-time for many common tasks.

\section{Discussion}
\noindent 
The development and evaluation of EdgeCoder offer several insights into the feasibility of offline multi-language code assistants. Here we discuss the system’s implications, limitations, and potential improvements.

\subsection{Portability and Edge Use-Cases}
EdgeCoder serves as a proof-of-concept that a code assistant can be brought to environments previously thought impractical for such technology. This could benefit educational deployments where students use a coding assistant on a local machine without internet—ensuring academic integrity and privacy. It could also be integrated into IoT or field systems (for example, assisting technicians in writing scripts on embedded devices on-site). The portability of C means the assistant could be compiled for various architectures (x86, ARM, etc.), and indeed we successfully cross-compiled it for a RISC-V based board as well.

\subsection{Comparison with Cloud-Based Models}
There is an inherent trade-off between the power of large models and the efficiency of smaller systems. EdgeCoder cannot compete with the coding prowess of a 100-billion-parameter cloud AI on very complex tasks or in writing lengthy, intricate codebases. Instead, it shines in well-bounded problems and boilerplate generation. Interestingly, our approach of combining fixed templates with simplified learning (the pattern matching in NLU) shows that for many “standard” tasks, a lightweight system can achieve results comparable to a giant model, at least in terms of functional correctness. This suggests a hybrid future: one could imagine a system that uses local generation for simple tasks and calls out to a cloud service only for more complex queries, thus balancing privacy and capability.

\subsection{Limitations}
A clear limitation of EdgeCoder is its reliance on pre-defined knowledge. If a user asks for something truly novel that doesn’t match our templates or simple strategies, the system may fail to produce a useful output. For example, a request like “simulate a Turing machine given an input tape” is likely beyond its current scope. Large LLMs can often handle such creative tasks better due to broad training. Another limitation is that our NLU can misinterpret queries if phrased unexpectedly—robust understanding is hard without deeper semantic models. This could be mitigated by incorporating a small language model (perhaps a distilled transformer with a few hundred million parameters that could be quantized to run on a Pi), an area for future exploration.

Multi-language support in EdgeCoder, while broad, also means not every nuance of each language is handled. During testing, we noticed that some outputs, though logically correct, might not be optimal or idiomatic. For instance, the Go code generator initially produced iterative solutions where a more Go-idiomatic recursive approach would be shorter; and the Swift generator didn’t utilize some of Swift’s functional programming conveniences. These are polish issues that could be improved with more rules and examples.

\subsection{Security and Safety}
Operating offline has security benefits (no code or prompts are sent to external servers), but it also means the onus is on the user to verify outputs. We attempted to include some safety checks, such as limiting the size of generated code to prevent runaway outputs and sanitizing the input to avoid malicious commands. Since EdgeCoder could conceivably be used in sensitive contexts, an interesting extension would be to integrate static analysis tools to check the generated code for security vulnerabilities or unsafe functions (especially in languages like C).

\subsection{Future Work}
There are several avenues to extend this research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning-Enhanced NLU}: Integrating a lightweight ML model for intent classification could improve the system’s ability to recognize more diverse requests. Even a small transformer or a well-trained classifier on code-related queries might boost accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Expanding the Knowledge Base}: We plan to incorporate more algorithm templates and possibly user-contributed examples. One idea is enabling EdgeCoder to learn new solutions over time: if the user provides a correct code for a new task, the system could abstract and store that in its library.
    \item \textbf{More Languages}: Support for additional programming languages (e.g., Rust, Kotlin, or MATLAB) can be added. This will test how flexible the IR is; we may need to extend the IR to accommodate unique features of those languages.
    \item \textbf{GUI Integration}: Currently, EdgeCoder is a command-line tool. Building a simple IDE plugin or text editor integration where offline suggestions pop up as you code would make it more user-friendly. This is feasible given the performance is already near real-time for small tasks.
    \item \textbf{Rigorous Benchmarks}: Finally, evaluating EdgeCoder on standard benchmarks like HumanEval or MBPP (a benchmark for code generation problems) would quantify how it stands relative to larger models. We expect it would not score as high, but such evaluation can pinpoint specific weakness to address.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\noindent 
We presented EdgeCoder, an offline, C-based AI code assistant that can interpret natural language programming requests and generate corresponding code in ten programming languages. The system’s design emphasizes modularity (with distinct NLU, intermediate representation, and code generation stages) and efficiency, allowing it to operate on hardware as modest as a Raspberry Pi without network connectivity. Through a combination of rule-based and lightweight learning techniques, EdgeCoder achieves a high success rate on common programming tasks, bridging a gap between the powerful capabilities of large cloud-backed models and the practical constraints of edge computing environments.

Our work demonstrates that useful code generation need not be exclusive to large-scale infrastructure. By leveraging the “wisdom of the software crowd” in the form of embedded knowledge and focusing on algorithmic essentials, an offline assistant can provide meaningful help to developers and learners. We hope this research inspires further innovation in bringing AI assistance to all programming environments, including those that are offline, private, or resource-limited. The lessons learned from EdgeCoder’s development highlight the importance of hybrid approaches and domain-specific optimizations in realizing the full potential of AI in software development.

\noindent In the above code, \texttt{NLU\_parse} fills a \texttt{TaskIntent} structure by analyzing the user request. The \texttt{IR\_construct} function either retrieves a template or builds an IR tree based on the intent. Then, depending on the \texttt{target\_lang} string, the corresponding generator function is called (e.g., \texttt{generate\_code\_Python} for Python). The output is collected in a buffer and printed. Each \texttt{generate\_code\_*} function is responsible for walking the IR tree and producing code in the specified language. Finally, \texttt{free\_ir} deallocates the intermediate representation. This snippet shows the modular design that allows easy extension to new languages.

To demonstrate EdgeCoder’s multi-language capabilities, we present the code it generates for the example task: “Write a function to determine whether a given integer is prime.” Below are outputs in each of the ten supported languages, as produced by the system. All implementations correctly determine if an integer $n$ is prime (returning true/false or equivalent).

\noindent\textbf{C:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <math.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool isPrime(int n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{C++:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#include <cmath>

bool isPrime(int n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{Java:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
class Solution {
    static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{Python:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{JavaScript:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
function isPrime(n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{C\#:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
public static bool IsPrime(int n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{Go:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Go]
func IsPrime(n int) bool {
    if n < 2 {
        return false
    }
    for i := 2; i * i <= n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{Ruby:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Ruby]
def is_prime?(n)
  return false if n < 2
  (2..Math.sqrt(n).floor).each do |i|
    return false if n % i == 0
  end
  true
end
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{PHP:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=PHP]
<?php
function isPrime($n) {
    if ($n < 2) return false;
    for ($i = 2; $i * $i <= $n; $i++) {
        if ($n % $i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
?>
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent\textbf{Swift:}
{\singlespacing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Swift]
func isPrime(_ n: Int) -> Bool {
    if n < 2 { return false }
    for i in 2...Int(Double(n).squareRoot()) {
        if n % i == 0 { 
            return false 
        }
    }
    return true
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent Each of the above code snippets was generated from the same Task Intent (primality test) and IR. Despite differences in syntax and some language-specific details (such as array indexing, loop constructs, etc.), they all implement the same fundamental algorithm. This demonstrates EdgeCoder’s capability to deliver consistent logic across languages, fulfilling the user's request in their language of choice.
